name: recon-scope-triage
description: Triage ASM/recon output for ownership before testing — separate the target's real assets from namespace-collision noise. Automated recon keyword-matches on the brand name, so for any target whose name is a common/dictionary word, the output is dominated by assets belonging to UNRELATED same-named companies (repos, cloud buckets, mobile apps, breach corpora, typosquats). Built from an authorized engagement where an ASM report's "Criticals" were overwhelmingly false positives and the combo/repos/mobile/bucket lists were polluted with unrelated same-named orgs. Use at the START of any engagement, immediately on receiving any ASM/recon/OSINT dataset, BEFORE testing anything.

## When to use this skill

Trigger when:
- The target brand is a common/dictionary word or shared term (e.g. `apex`, `summit`, `vertex`, `nova`, `core`, `orbit`, `pulse`, `unity`…)
- You receive an ASM report, recon export, breach combo, repo list, bucket list, or mobile-app list to act on
- A "Critical" count looks implausibly high (hundreds) for the org's size
- Any asset's ownership is asserted by the tool but not *proven*

The two failure modes this skill prevents:
1. **Wasting the engagement** testing/triaging assets that aren't the target's.
2. **Attacking an innocent third party** that merely shares the name — out of scope, and real harm.

**Rule: ownership is guilty-until-proven. An asset is the target's only when a concrete ownership signal ties it to the target — never because a scanner's keyword matched.**

## The collision sources (where keyword-matching lies)

| Recon source | How it collides | Verify ownership by |
|---|---|---|
| **GitHub repos** | Search matched the brand word in repo name / topic / a string | Repo owner is the org's GH org; commits from org emails; code references the org's real domains/infra. A repo named `<word>-backend` by a random user = noise. |
| **Cloud buckets** (S3/GCS) | Bucket names are a **global namespace**; `<word>-static`, `<word>-data`, `<word>-public` exist for *someone* | Bucket content references the target; bucket name correlates with a *confirmed* target subdomain (`x.target.com` ↔ `x-public`) AND content matches; ACL/owner metadata. Generic content (other-language, other-industry) = not theirs. |
| **Mobile apps** | Store search matched the brand word in app name / package | Publisher account = the org; package reverse-DNS = an owned domain (`com.<owneddomain>.app`); dev cert; app calls owned API hosts. Mature ASM tools emit an "apps_accepted=0" / ownership-confidence field — read it. |
| **Breach corpora / combos** | Email local-or-domain contains the brand word | **Exact** owned-domain match only (`@target.com`), not `@<word>group.com` / `@something<word>.com`. A different domain that contains the word is a different org. |
| **Typosquats** | Generated permutations of the name | These are *defensive*/brand-protection findings, not offensive scope — note and move on. |
| **Stack/forum/paste hits** | Brand word in body | Body references the target's real domain/subdomain/employee/secret. Ownership-confidence < threshold = drop. |

## Web "Critical" triage — the soft-404 control

Automated `.env` / `.git` / `actuator` / admin-panel "Criticals" are overwhelmingly **soft-404s**: SPA/framework catch-alls returning HTTP 200 (or 403) for *every* path. Verify EACH before believing it:
```bash
# the "finding"
curl -s -o /tmp/a -w "%{http_code} %{size_download}\n" <target>
# a junk control on the same host
curl -s -o /tmp/b -w "%{http_code} %{size_download}\n" <target>
# identical byte length / body  →  FALSE POSITIVE (catch-all), discard
cmp -s /tmp/a /tmp/b && echo "SOFT-404 false positive" || echo "differs — investigate"
```
Real exposures have a content-type + signature that differs from the catch-all (`.git/config` starts `[core]`; `.env` has `KEY=value`; phpinfo has the XHTML-transitional doctype + `PHP Version`). A physical `.php`/`phpinfo.php` that returns a *bigger/different* body than the junk control is the real-vs-soft-404 tell.

## The triage workflow

1. **Confirm the canonical owned-domain set first** (the SOW/program domain + its verified subdomains + the verified Entra/Okta/Google tenant brand name). This is your ownership anchor.
2. **For each asset class, apply the verify-by column above.** No signal → quarantine, don't test.
3. **Re-baseline the severity counts** against only-owned assets. Report the *delta* — "N Criticals → M after ownership + soft-404 triage" is itself a finding about the ASM program.
4. **Quarantine collisions explicitly** (a `loot/quarantined_<source>.txt`) so it's auditable that you saw them and chose not to target them.
5. **Surface the meta-finding:** if the supplied ASM/recon feed is mostly false-positive, that misallocates the owner's remediation budget and buries real risk — write it up (Medium/Strategic).

## Anti-patterns

- **Trusting the tool's "owned" label.** Tools keyword-match; they don't prove ownership. Verify.
- **Targeting a same-named third party** because it was "in the report." Out of scope + real harm. A combo line `user@<word>company.com` is a different company's employee.
- **Reporting soft-404s as exposures.** Always run the junk-path control.
- **Counting typosquats / missing-headers / brand-collision repos as offensive findings.** They're defensive/hygiene/noise — they pad the report and erode credibility.
- **Skipping triage "to save time."** Untriaged, you spend the whole engagement on other people's assets and find nothing real.

---

## Why this matters (calibration)

For a target whose brand is a common word, expect the bulk of automated "owned" assets to be collisions:
- **Repos** that are unrelated open-source projects (ad-block lists, scrapers, student projects, a different company's SDK) merely containing the word.
- **Mobile apps** published by entirely different companies that share the name — banks, credit unions, dating apps, dispensaries, home-care services are all real-world collision categories. (Good ASM tooling will tell you it accepted *zero* as owned.)
- **Cloud buckets** in the global namespace holding some unrelated org's content (other-language documents, demo/sample data, another industry's files).
- **Breach combos** full of emails from sibling-named-but-different companies (`<word>group.com`, `<region><word>.com`).

On a real engagement against a dictionary-word brand, after clearing this noise the only genuinely-owned high-severity finding was discoverable solely by manual tradecraft (a JS-bundle → API discovery, see `hunt-spa-api`) — it was nowhere in the hundreds of scanner "Criticals." Triage-first is what made the engagement productive instead of a goose chase.

## Related Skills & Chains

- **`triage-validation`** — asset-ownership triage (this skill) precedes finding-validity triage (the 7-Question Gate). Ownership first, then validity.
- **`redteam-mindset`** — "aggressive default" means probe every *owned* live surface; this skill defines which surfaces are owned so persistence isn't wasted on collisions.
- **`hunt-spa-api`** — once an API host passes ownership triage, this is how you test it.
- **`offensive-osint` / `osint-methodology`** — feed ownership anchors (verified domains, tenant brand, dev accounts) from OSINT into this triage.
