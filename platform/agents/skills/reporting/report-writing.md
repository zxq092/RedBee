# REPORT WRITING

Impact-first. Human tone. No theoretical language. Triagers are people.

---

## THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE

> **Never use "could potentially" or "could be used to" or "may allow".**
> Either it does the thing or it doesn't. If you haven't proved it, don't claim it.

```
BAD:  "This vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to access user data."
GOOD: "An attacker can access any user's order history by changing the user_id
       parameter to the target user's ID. I confirmed this using two test accounts:
       attacker@test.com (ID 123) successfully retrieved victim@test.com (ID 456)
       orders, including their shipping address and payment method last 4 digits."
```

---

## TITLE FORMULA

```
[Bug Class] in [Exact Endpoint/Feature] allows [attacker role] to [impact] [victim scope]
```

**Good titles (specific, impact-first):**
```
IDOR in /api/v2/invoices/{id} allows authenticated user to read any customer's invoice data
Missing auth on POST /api/admin/users allows unauthenticated attacker to create admin accounts
Stored XSS in profile bio field executes in admin panel — allows privilege escalation
SSRF via image import URL parameter reaches AWS EC2 metadata service
Race condition in coupon redemption allows same code to be used unlimited times
```

**Bad titles (vague, useless to triager):**
```
IDOR vulnerability found
Broken access control
XSS in user input
Security issue in API
Unauthorized access to user data
```

## HACKERONE REPORT TEMPLATE

```markdown
## Summary

[One paragraph: what the bug is, where it is, what an attacker can do. Be specific.
Include: endpoint, method, parameter, data exposed, required access level.]

Example: "The `/api/users/{user_id}/orders` endpoint does not verify that the
authenticated user owns the requested user_id. An attacker can enumerate any
user's order history, including PII (email, address, phone) and purchase history,
by incrementing the user_id parameter. No privileges beyond a standard free
account are required."

## Vulnerability Details

**Vulnerability Type:** IDOR / Broken Object Level Authorization
**CVSS 3.1 Score:** 6.5 (Medium) — AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
**Affected Endpoint:** GET /api/users/{user_id}/orders

## Steps to Reproduce

**Environment:**
- Attacker account: attacker@test.com, user_id = 123
- Victim account: victim@test.com, user_id = 456
- Target: <target>

**Steps:**

1. Log in as attacker@test.com, obtain Bearer token

2. Send the following request:

```
GET /api/users/456/orders HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Authorization: Bearer ATTACKER_TOKEN_HERE
```

3. Observe response:

```json
{
  "orders": [
    {"id": 789, "items": [...], "email": "victim@test.com", "address": "123 Main St..."}
  ]
}
```

The response contains victim's full order history and PII despite being requested
by a different user.

## Impact

An authenticated attacker can enumerate all user orders by iterating user_id values.
This exposes: full name, email, shipping address, purchase history, and payment
method (last 4). With ~100K users, this represents a mass PII breach affecting
all registered users. Exploitation requires only a free account and takes minutes
with a simple loop.

## Recommended Fix

Add server-side ownership verification:
```python
if order.user_id != current_user.id:
    raise Forbidden()
```

## Supporting Materials

[Screenshot showing attacker's session returning victim's order data]
[Video walkthrough if available]
```

## BUGCROWD REPORT TEMPLATE

```markdown
# [IDOR] User order history accessible without authorization via /api/users/{id}/orders

**VRT Category:** Broken Access Control > IDOR > P2

## Description

[Same impact-first paragraph as HackerOne summary]

## Steps to Reproduce

[Same structured steps — exact HTTP requests, exact responses]

## Proof of Concept

[Screenshot/video showing the actual impact]

## Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected:** 403 Forbidden when user_id does not match authenticated user
**Actual:** 200 OK with victim's full order data

## Severity Justification

P2 (High) — Direct read access to other users' PII. Affects all user accounts.
No user interaction required. Exploitable by any authenticated user.
Automated enumeration could exfil all [N] user records in minutes.

## Remediation

Add ownership verification: `if order.user_id != current_user.id: raise 403`
```

## INTIGRITI REPORT TEMPLATE

```markdown
# [Bug Class]: [Exact Impact] in [Endpoint/Feature]

## Description

[Impact-first paragraph. Start with what an attacker can do, not with how you found it.
Include: endpoint, method, parameter, data exposed, required privileges.]

## Steps to Reproduce

**Environment:**
- Attacker: email=attacker@test.com (standard account, no special role)
- Victim: email=victim@test.com
- Tested: [date]

**Reproduction steps:**

1. [Login as attacker / visit URL / send request]

2. Send the following HTTP request:

\```http
METHOD /endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Authorization: Bearer ATTACKER_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{"param": "victim_id_here"}
\```

3. Observe response contains victim's private data:

\```json
{"email": "victim@test.com", "address": "123 Main St", ...}
\```

## Impact

[Specific, quantified impact. What data, how many users, what can attacker do.]

CVSS 3.1 Score: X.X ([Severity]) — AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

## Remediation

[1-3 sentence concrete fix. Include code if helpful.]

## Attachments

[Screenshot or Loom video showing the impact — Intigriti triagers prefer video for complex bugs]
```

**Intigriti-specific notes:**
- Title format: `[Bug Class]: [One-line impact]` (no formula required, but keep it specific)
- Severity is set by you: Critical/High/Medium/Low/Exceptional
- CVSS 3.1 is standard (CVSS 4.0 also accepted on newer programs)
- PoC video is valued much more than screenshot alone — record with Loom
- Safe harbor: Intigriti enforces it, be comfortable going slightly aggressive with testing

## CVSS 3.1 QUICK SCORING

### Formula
```
CVSS = f(AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A)
```

### Metric Quick Picks

| Metric | Value | Weight | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Attack Vector (AV)** | Network | +0.85 | Via internet |
| | Local | +0.55 | Local access needed |
| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | Low | +0.77 | Repeatable |
| | High | +0.44 | Race/timing needed |
| **Privileges Required (PR)** | None | +0.85 | No login |
| | Low | +0.62 | Regular user account |
| | High | +0.27 | Admin account |
| **User Interaction (UI)** | None | +0.85 | No victim action |
| | Required | +0.62 | Victim must click |
| **Scope (S)** | Changed | higher | Affects browser/OS/other |
| | Unchanged | lower | Stays in app |
| **Confidentiality (C)** | High | +0.56 | All data exposed |
| | Low | +0.22 | Limited data |
| **Integrity (I)** | High | +0.56 | Can modify any data |
| **Availability (A)** | High | +0.56 | Crashes service |

### Typical Scores by Bug Class

| Bug | Typical CVSS | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| IDOR (read PII) | 6.5 | Medium |
| IDOR (write/delete) | 7.5 | High |
| Auth bypass → admin | 9.8 | Critical |
| Stored XSS (any user) | 5.4–8.8 | Med–High |
| SQLi (data exfil) | 8.6 | High |
| SSRF (cloud metadata) | 9.1 | Critical |
| Race condition (double spend) | 7.5 | High |
| GraphQL auth bypass | 8.7 | High |
| JWT none algorithm | 9.1 | Critical |

---

## SEVERITY DECISION GUIDE

### Critical (P1)
- Full account takeover of any user without interaction
- Remote code execution
- SQLi with ability to dump/modify entire DB
- Auth bypass to admin panel
- SSRF to cloud metadata → IAM credentials exfil

### High (P2)
- Mass PII exposure (email, phone, SSN, payment data)
- Privilege escalation from user to admin
- SSRF reaching internal services (data returned)
- Stored XSS executing for all users of sensitive feature
- Payment bypass / financial loss without limit

### Medium (P3)
- IDOR on specific user's non-critical data
- XSS on low-sensitivity page requiring victim interaction
- CSRF on important but non-critical action
- Rate limit bypass on OTP (with effort demonstrated)

### Low (P4)
- Information disclosure (non-sensitive, no PII)
- Clickjacking on sensitive action WITH working PoC
- CORS on limited data

---

## SEVERITY SELF-ASSESSMENT

Each YES raises severity:
```
1. Exposes PII / health / financial data of other users?        → +1 severity
2. Allows account takeover or privilege escalation?             → +2 severity
3. Requires ZERO user interaction from victim?                  → +1 severity
4. Affects ALL users (not specific condition)?                  → +1 severity
5. Remotely exploitable with no internal network access?        → baseline for High+
```

## DOWNGRADE COUNTERS

| Program Says | Counter With |
|---|---|
| "Requires authentication" | "Attacker needs only a free account — no special role or permission" |
| "Limited impact" | "Affects [N] users / exposes [PII type] / $[amount] at risk" |
| "Already known" | "Show me the report number — I searched hacktivity and found none" |
| "By design" | "Show me the documentation stating this is intended behavior" |
| "Low CVSS" | "CVSS doesn't capture business impact — attacker can extract [X] in [Y] minutes" |
| "Not exploitable" | "Here is the exact response showing victim's data returned to attacker session" |

## CVSS 4.0 QUICK REFERENCE (newer programs)

CVSS 4.0 replaced CVSS 3.1 in November 2023. Some newer programs require it.

### Key Differences from CVSS 3.1

| Metric | CVSS 3.1 | CVSS 4.0 |
|---|---|---|
| Attack Vector | Network/Adjacent/Local/Physical | Same |
| Attack Complexity | Low/High | Low/High |
| **NEW**: Attack Requirements | (didn't exist) | None/Present (replaces some PR/UI) |
| Privileges Required | None/Low/High | Same |
| User Interaction | None/Required | None/Passive/Active |
| Scope | Unchanged/Changed | REMOVED |
| **NEW**: Sub-Impact metrics | (didn't exist) | Vulnerable/Subsequent system impact |

### CVSS 4.0 Score Examples

| Finding | CVSS 4.0 Score | Vector |
|---|---|---|
| Unauthenticated RCE | 10.0 | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H |
| IDOR read PII, auth required | 6.9 | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N |
| Stored XSS, admin views it | 8.2 | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:N |
| SSRF → cloud metadata | 8.7 | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:N |

### Quick CVSS 4.0 Calculator
```
Use: <target>
Key fields:
  VC/VI/VA = Vulnerable System Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability
  SC/SI/SA = Subsequent System (downstream impact)
  AT = None (no special condition) | Present (race/specific config needed)
  UI = None | Passive (victim visits URL) | Active (victim takes explicit action)
```

**Practical rule**: If program uses CVSS 4.0 and you don't know the vector, use the calculator and include the full string starting with `CVSS:4.0/AV:...`. Programs cannot dispute a valid vector string.

---

## HUMAN TONE GUIDELINES

**Write to a person, not a system:**
- Triagers are tired. Get to the impact in sentence 1.
- Use "I" not "the researcher" — you found it, own it
- Short paragraphs, bullet points for steps
- Hyperlink relevant docs if needed

**Escalation language (when payout is being downgraded):**
```
"This vulnerability does not require any special privileges — only a free account."
"The exposed data includes [PII type], which is subject to GDPR requirements."
"An attacker can automate this with a simple loop — all [N] records in minutes."
"This is exploitable externally without network access to any internal system."
"The impact is equivalent to a full data breach of [feature/data type]."
```

**Avoid:**
- Jargon the triager might not know
- 5-paragraph explanations of what IDOR is (they know)
- Theoretical chains ("could be combined with X to...")
- Passive voice ("it was observed that...")
- Qualifying language ("seems to," "appears to")

---

## STEPS TO REPRODUCE FORMAT (triager-optimized)

```markdown
**Setup:**
- Account A (attacker): email=attacker@test.com, ID=111
- Account B (victim): email=victim@test.com, ID=222
- Both created via normal registration — no special access

**Steps:**

1. Log in as Account A
2. Send this request (replace `111` with victim ID `222`):

\```
GET /api/v2/resource/222 HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Authorization: Bearer ACCOUNT_A_TOKEN
\```

3. Response contains Account B's private data:

\```json
{"id": 222, "email": "victim@test.com", "name": "Victim User", "address": "..."}
\```

**Expected:** 403 Forbidden
**Actual:** 200 OK with victim's private data
```

## Related Skills & Chains

- **`triage-validation`** — When deciding whether to write a report at all. Workflow primitive: NEVER open this skill before `triage-validation`'s 7-Question Gate passes; a finding that fails the gate should be killed, not written up.
- **`bugcrowd-reporting`** — When the target is a Bugcrowd program. Workflow primitive: this skill's body template is the foundation; `bugcrowd-reporting` overlays VRT selection, severity-request paragraph, OOS-clause rebuttals on top.
- **`evidence-hygiene`** — When PoC screenshots / HARs are being attached to the report. Workflow primitive: every artifact referenced in the "Supporting Materials" / "Proof of Concept" section gets routed through `evidence-hygiene` for cookie + PII redaction before attachment.
- **`redteam-report-template`** — When the engagement is an external red team (NOT bug bounty). Workflow primitive: confirm engagement mode via `bb-methodology` PART 0; if red-team, swap this skill out for `redteam-report-template` (different audience, different structure: Subject / Observations / Description / Impact / Recommendation / PoC).

## Operator Notes (Claude-BugHunter)

> Engagement-derived additions to the vendored foundation. Wisdom from real
> authorized engagements + Phase 2 verification across this repo's 31+
> skill-area live tests. The upstream methodology covers the WHAT; this
> layer covers the WHEN-IT-ACTUALLY-WORKS and the FAILURE-MODES.

### Title formula in practice

`<asset> | <bug class> | <impact>` — three components, no fluff. Triagers read titles in roughly three seconds and use them to order the queue.

- BAD: "Interesting finding on /api/users"
- BAD: "IDOR vulnerability in API"
- GOOD: "Authenticated IDOR on /api/users/{uid} -> admin email + role disclosure"
- GOOD: "Unauthenticated SSRF on /preview?url= -> AWS metadata <ip> reachable"

The bad titles get opened last. The good titles get opened first. Same finding, different queue position, different triage day, different payout speed.

### What triagers actually read

Their reading sequence on a fresh report:

1. **Title** (3 seconds)
2. **First paragraph of impact / summary** (15 seconds)
3. **The curl command or HTTP request block** (30 seconds)
4. **Reproduction steps** (only if the first three were convincing)
5. **Everything else** (only on follow-up review)

Optimize the top of the report ruthlessly. Save narrative for the middle. Triagers who are convinced by step 3 will rubber-stamp the rest; triagers who aren't convinced by step 3 won't read step 5.

### CVSS 3.1 vs Bugcrowd VRT vs H1 default severity

These three systems disagree about 30% of the time. The most common gap: a finding that scores CVSS 7.x (High) maps to Bugcrowd P4 (Low) or H1 Medium-default. When the platform default rates lower than CVSS:

1. **File the severity-request paragraph as the first body section.** Bugcrowd respects this. (See `bugcrowd-reporting` for the canonical template.)
2. **Anchor the request in CVSS vector string + business impact, not feelings.** "CVSS 3.1 AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N = 7.5 High because Confidentiality:High applies to cross-tenant data exposure."
3. **Cite the platform's own VRT entry** that matches your finding. Don't argue against the platform; route within it.

An authorized bug-bounty engagement saw P4-default findings escalated to P3 via the severity-request paragraph. The escalation isn't automatic — you have to ask, with grounded reasoning, in the first body section.

### Evidence rotation

Everything in the submission body is logged forever by the platform. Operate accordingly:

- Use throwaway test accounts created specifically for the engagement.
- Rotate cookies / tokens after each submission (don't reuse the cookie that's pasted in the report).
- Never paste production cookies, real user emails, or real PII into the report body — redact in the PoC step.
- Screenshots of admin panels: blur the user list, blur the URL bar if it contains tokens.

Cross-link `evidence-hygiene` for the full capture-and-redact protocol.

### Templates by platform — when they differ

| Platform | Tone | Required Structure | Severity Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| HackerOne | Narrative | Summary -> Steps -> Impact -> Suggested fix | Triager-set, contestable |
| Bugcrowd | Structured | Severity request -> VRT category -> Title -> Body -> Remediation | VRT-default + manual override paragraph |
| Intigriti | Between | Summary -> PoC -> Impact -> Recommendation | Researcher-proposed, triager-confirmed |
| Immunefi | PoC-first | Working PoC code -> Walkthrough -> Impact -> Severity | Foundry/Hardhat code is the primary deliverable |

Picking the wrong template style costs validity. A narrative-heavy Bugcrowd report misses the VRT mapping the triager needs; a structured H1 report reads as terse and gets follow-up questions that delay payout.

### The single biggest report-writing mistake

Claiming an attack works "in theory" or "could be chained to [bigger impact]" without demonstrating it. Triage-validation Q6 (impact beyond technically possible) kills these on the validation side; report-writing has to mirror it on the writing side.

Two valid paths:

1. **Show concrete impact end-to-end.** Capture the chain on a test account. Paste the full request/response sequence. Done.
2. **Downgrade the severity claim to match what you actually demonstrated.** "IDOR on /api/users/{uid} reading email + role" is real and reportable; "IDOR chained to potential admin takeover" is not until you demonstrate the takeover.

Pick one. Never split the difference with "could potentially" or "may allow" — those phrases are the triager's signal that the report is theoretical, and theoretical reports get N/A.
- **`bb-methodology`** — When Phase 5's report-writing step starts. Workflow primitive: Phase 5 calls `/report` which loads this skill for the platform-specific template (H1 / Bugcrowd / Intigriti / Immunefi).
