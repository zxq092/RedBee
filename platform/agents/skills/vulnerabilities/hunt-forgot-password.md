description: "Hunt Forgot Password / Account Recovery Authentication Flaws — 5 distinct patterns: (1) username enumeration via different responses for valid vs invalid email, (2) reset token exposed directly in the API response body, (3) reset token not invalidated after use (replay), (4) password reset link works from a different IP/browser (no binding), (5) no rate limit on the reset request endpoint. These are the standalone recovery-flow broken-auth primitives — distinct from reset-email host-header poisoning (hunt-host-header) and the full ATO chain (hunt-ato owns password-reset as an ATO path; prove the primitive here, chain it there). Detection: trace the full forgot-password flow from request to token to use; check response diffs between valid/invalid emails; test token replay after consumption. Medium to High (enumeration=Medium, token-reuse=High, account-takeover=Critical when chained to known-email)."

## Autonomous Testing Priority

**Start with username enumeration — it's the fastest win and gates the rest.**

**Pattern 1 — Username enumeration (response difference for valid vs invalid email):**
1. POST to the forgot-password endpoint with a clearly invalid email (e.g. `nonexistent@fakedomain12345.com`) — record the response body, status code, and length
2. POST with an email you know exists (or try common patterns like `admin@target.com`, `test@target.com`, `user@target.com`)
3. Compare responses: different message ("Email sent" vs "Email not found"), different HTTP status, or meaningfully different body length = username enumeration confirmed
4. Proof: enumeration is confirmed when the two responses differ measurably (baseline vs probe) in message text, status code, or body length

**Pattern 2 — Reset token exposed in the API response:**
Some APIs return the reset token directly in the response body (instead of only emailing it). POST to the forgot-password endpoint and look for a token, link, or code in the JSON/HTML response. If a token appears that lets you reset the password, that's an immediate account-takeover vector.

**Pattern 3 — Reset token replay (reuse after use):**
1. Complete a full password reset cycle: request token → use it to reset password
2. Immediately try submitting the same token again to the reset-password endpoint
3. If the second submission returns 200 or "success" → token not invalidated after use

**Pattern 4 — No rate limit on reset requests:**
Submit the forgot-password endpoint 10-20 times rapidly with the same email. If all succeed without a 429, lockout, or CAPTCHA → no rate limit (enumeration + token flooding is possible).

**Content-type:** Forgot-password endpoints are often JSON-based REST APIs. Use `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` only if the endpoint is a traditional HTML form (check the login page's HTML to determine form encoding).

**Proof:** Username enumeration = measurably different response (body/status/length). Token exposure = token in response body. Token replay = second successful use of a consumed token.

## Vulnerability Classes in This Skill

### 1. Username Enumeration via Password Reset
Different error messages for valid vs invalid accounts leaks the user list without authentication. Even timing differences (fast "no user found" vs slow "email queued") count.

High-value targets: admin accounts, employee email patterns, API keys derived from usernames.

### 2. Weak / Predictable Reset Tokens
A reset token derived from timestamp, username, or sequential IDs can be brute-forced:
- `base64(email + timestamp)` — decodable
- 4-6 digit numeric code — 10K guesses, easily feasible with no rate limit
- Sequential `token=1234`, `token=1235` — trivially enumerable

### 3. Token Not Bound to Session or IP
Most apps generate a token, email it, and accept it from any browser. A truly bound token should only work from the same IP or require the original session cookie. If neither is enforced → link forwarding = account takeover.

**Token leak via `Referer` / third-party resources.** When the token rides in the reset-page URL (`/reset?token=…`) and that page loads any cross-origin resource (analytics, ads, fonts, a CDN image), the full URL — token included — leaks to that third party in the `Referer` header. Check the reset page's outbound requests: if the token appears in any cross-origin `Referer`, it's harvestable without the victim's inbox. Same leak via a `<meta name=referrer>` misconfig or an outbound link the victim clicks from the reset page. Disclosed token-leak→ATO class: <<target>>.

### 4. Reset Link Doesn't Expire
Common best practice: reset tokens expire within ~15–60 minutes (no hard RFC mandates the exact value; OWASP recommends a short, single-use lifetime). If a token from 24 hours ago still works → persistence risk for phishing attacks.

### 5. No Rate Limit on Reset Endpoint
An uncapped reset endpoint enables:
- Email flooding (DoS against victim's inbox)
- Token brute-force if the token space is small
- Username enumeration at scale
