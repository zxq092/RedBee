## Firing a race — two primitives (tooling-agnostic)

Winning a race needs requests that arrive in the *same* narrow window — sequential sends never
work. Use a single-packet / synchronized-send tool: **Burp Repeater** "Send group in parallel"
(HTTP/2 single-packet attack), **Turbo Intruder** (`engine=Engine.BURP2`, `gate` sync), or any
client that can flush N requests simultaneously. Two shapes:

- **Identical-copies race** — fire N IDENTICAL copies of one request at once (limit-overrun:
  double-spend a coupon/gift-card, exceed a one-per-user quota). Success = ≥2 of the N return 2xx.
- **Different-requests race (partial construction)** — fire a LIST of DIFFERENT requests in one
  synchronized window, repeated over several rounds. For register-then-confirm / TOCTOU races
  where the object exists in a usable state mid-creation. Example (email-verification bypass —
  register an arbitrary email, then confirm it through the construction window with a blank token):
  ```
  Request A:  POST /register   body: csrf=<csrf>&username=hacker&email=anything@exploit.net&password=pw
  Request B:  GET  /confirm    params: token=   (empty)
  Fire A and B together, repeat ~20 rounds.
  ```
  Get a fresh CSRF from `GET /register` first, then fire the batch. After it succeeds, log in as the
  new account and perform the objective (e.g. a state-changing admin action such as deleting a user).
  The blank-token confirm wins during the window where the user row exists but its verification
  token isn't set yet.

## Crown Jewel Targets

Race conditions are high-severity findings because they break financial, access control, and integrity assumptions that defenders rarely stress-test. Highest payouts come from:

- **Monetary/credit systems** — double-spending gift cards, coupons, referral bonuses, promotional credits, wallet balances
- **Vote/reputation manipulation** — upvoting the same content multiple times, gaming leaderboards or trending algorithms
- **Account limits bypass** — exceeding free-tier quotas, bypassing "one per user" restrictions on invites, trial activations, or API key generation
- **Privilege escalation** — racing role assignment or permission checks during user creation/upgrade flows
- **Deletion bypass** — reading or exfiltrating data during a narrow window between "marked for deletion" and "actually deleted"
- **Payment flows** — charging a card once but receiving multiple fulfillments

**Best-paying asset types:** Fintech apps, SaaS platforms with credit/subscription models, social platforms with reputation systems, e-commerce checkout flows, OAuth/SSO token endpoints.

## Attack Surface Signals

### URL Patterns
```
/vote, /upvote, /like, /favorite
/redeem, /apply-coupon, /use-code, /claim
/purchase, /checkout, /confirm-order, /pay
/transfer, /withdraw, /send-money
/invite, /referral, /accept-invite
/upgrade, /activate, /trial
/delete, /deactivate, /cancel
/follow, /subscribe
```

### Response Headers That Signal Race-Prone Backends
```
X-RateLimit-*        # rate limiting exists, but may not be atomic
X-Request-Id         # each request independently tracked
No Cache-Control     # stateful ops not idempotent
```

### JavaScript Patterns to Grep
```javascript
// Single-use action buttons with client-side disable
button.disabled = true
$('#btn').prop('disabled', true)
// Optimistic UI updates (state set before server confirms)
setState({ used: true })
// Sequential async calls without locking
await useVoucher(); await deductBalance();
```

### Tech Stack Signals
- **Ruby on Rails** without `with_lock` / `lock!` — ActiveRecord doesn't lock by default
- **Node.js** with async/await chains — non-atomic DB reads then writes
- **PHP** without `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` — common in legacy codebases
- **Microservices** — inter-service calls introduce natural TOCTOU windows
- **Redis counters** without Lua scripts or `INCR` atomicity checks
- **Message queues** — idempotency keys often missing

## Step-by-Step Hunting Methodology

1. **Enumerate one-time or limited-use actions** — Map every endpoint that enforces a "once per user", "limited quantity", or "deduct balance" constraint. These are your primary targets.

2. **Understand the state machine** — For each target action, identify: (a) what state is read, (b) what state is written, (c) what validation sits between read and write. The gap between read and write is your window.

3. **Capture a clean baseline request** — Perform the action once legitimately with Burp Suite intercepting. Confirm you get the expected single-use behavior (e.g., coupon marked used, vote counted once).

4. **Set up parallel request tooling** — Use one of:
   - Burp Suite Repeater → "Send group in parallel" (Turbo Intruder for HTTP/2 single-packet attacks)
   - Turbo Intruder with `engine=Engine.BURP2` for last-byte sync
   - `curl` with `&` backgrounding
   - Python `threading` or `asyncio` with pre-built connections

5. **Execute the race** — Send 10–50 identical requests simultaneously. Key technique: **pre-connect and buffer all requests, release the final byte of all simultaneously** (single-packet attack when HTTP/2 is available).

6. **Analyze responses** — Look for:
   - Multiple `200 OK` where only one should succeed
   - Duplicate success messages
   - Database constraint errors (signals the race worked but hit the last-line-of-defense)
   - Inconsistent response times (one fast, rest slow = serialized; all same speed = parallel processing)

7. **Verify the effect** — Check the actual state: Was the credit applied twice? Did the vote count increment multiple times? Is the coupon still marked unused despite two successes?

8. **Determine exploitability window** — Re-run with decreasing parallelism (5 requests, 3 requests, 2 requests) to understand how tight the window is and reliability of exploitation.

9. **Test across account types** — Sometimes the race only works for new accounts, specific subscription tiers, or under specific server load. Test varied conditions.

10. **Document reproducibility** — Record exact timing, number of parallel requests needed, and success rate across 5 independent attempts before reporting.

## Payload & Detection Patterns

### Turbo Intruder — Basic Parallel Race
```python
# turbo_intruder_race.py
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,
                           concurrentConnections=1,
                           engine=Engine.BURP2)  # HTTP/2 single-packet
    for i in range(20):
        engine.queue(target.req, gate='race1')
    engine.openGate('race1')

def handleResponse(req, interesting):
    if '200' in req.status:
        table.add(req)
```

### curl — Parallel Requests (bash)
```bash
# Fire 15 simultaneous vote/redeem requests
for i in $(seq 1 15); do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
    -X POST "<target>" \
    -H "Cookie: session=YOUR_SESSION" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"report_id": "12345", "vote": "up"}' &
done
wait
```

### Python asyncio Race
```python
import asyncio, aiohttp

async def race_request(session, url, payload, headers):
    async with session.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers) as r:
        return await r.text()

async def main():
    url = "<target>"
    payload = {"code": "GIFT50"}
    headers = {"Cookie": "session=XXXXX"}
    
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [race_request(session, url, payload, headers) for _ in range(20)]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
    for r in results:
        print(r[:100])  # print first 100 chars of each response

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Grep Patterns for Source Code Auditing
```bash
# Look for read-then-write without locking
grep -rn "find_by\|where.*first" --include="*.rb" | grep -v "lock"
grep -rn "SELECT.*WHERE" --include="*.php" | grep -v "FOR UPDATE"

# JavaScript async without atomicity
grep -rn "await.*get\|await.*find" --include="*.js" -A2 | grep "await.*update\|await.*save"

# Python Django ORM without select_for_update
grep -rn "\.get(\|\.filter(" --include="*.py" | grep -v "select_for_update"
```

### HTTP/2 Single-Packet Check
```bash
# Verify target supports HTTP/2 (prerequisite for single-packet attack)
curl -sI --http2 <target> | grep -i "HTTP/2\|h2"
```

---

## Common Root Causes

1. **Check-Then-Act without atomic operations** — Developer reads state (`if voucher.used == false`), then writes state (`voucher.update(used: true)`) in two separate database operations. Any thread can read the same "unused" state before either writes.

2. **Missing database-level locking** — Using ORM methods like `find` or `filter` instead of `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`. The fix is one line but developers don't think about concurrency.

3. **Optimistic concurrency without version checking** — Systems increment counters or mark records without checking if the record changed since it was read.

4. **Microservice TOCTOU** — Service A validates eligibility, Service B executes the action. No shared atomic transaction spans both services.

5. **Client-side "protection"** — Developers disable the button in JavaScript after first click, assuming that prevents duplicate submissions. Server-side logic is never hardened.

6. **Counter increments outside transactions** — `votes_count += 1; save()` instead of an atomic SQL `UPDATE SET votes = votes + 1 WHERE id = ?`.

7. **Async background jobs** — Eligibility checked synchronously, fulfillment done asynchronously. A second request passes the check before the first job completes.

8. **Caching without invalidation** — Cached "has user voted?" check returns stale `false` during a cache miss window when the first write hasn't propagated yet.

---

## Bypass Techniques

### What Defenders Implement (and How to Bypass)

**Defense: Per-user rate limiting**
- Bypass: Rate limits are checked before the action executes. Send requests simultaneously — all pass the rate-limit check before any is counted.

**Defense: Idempotency keys / unique request tokens**
- Bypass: If the server generates or reuses the token, try sending parallel requests without the token. Or check if the uniqueness check itself has a race window.

**Defense: Database unique constraints**
- Bypass: The constraint catches duplicates *after* the race. The first two may both succeed before DB enforces. Look for partial fulfillment — sometimes one succeeds and one errors but both are honored.

**Defense: Short time windows / expiring tokens**
- Bypass: Pre-stage all requests with valid tokens. Use single-packet HTTP/2 to release all in one TCP frame — server processes them in the same scheduler slot.

**Defense: Queue-based serialization**
- Bypass: Multiple queues (or multiple workers consuming the same queue) can pick up duplicate messages. Test by overwhelming the queue during the window.

**Defense: Application-layer mutex / locks**
- Bypass: Distributed systems running multiple app servers don't share in-process locks. Send requests to the same endpoint via different CDN nodes or load-balanced servers.

**Defense: "Already used" checks in application code**
- Bypass: The check and the update are separate. The check passes for both racing requests before either update completes. Only an atomic `UPDATE ... WHERE used=false RETURNING id` truly prevents this.

---

## Gate 0 Validation

Before writing the report, confirm all three:

1. **What can the attacker DO right now?**
   Can you demonstrate — with screenshots or logs — that the same one-time action succeeded more than once? (e.g., vote count shows +2 from one user, credit balance shows double-credit, coupon shows redeemed twice)

2. **What does the victim LOSE?**
   Is there concrete, measurable harm? Financial loss (credits issued in excess), integrity loss (manipulated rankings/votes), or security loss (access granted beyond entitlement)? "The counter went up twice" is only valid if that counter has real-world value.

3. **Can it be reproduced in 10 minutes from scratch?**
   Can you write a 20-line script, run it against a fresh test account, and reliably demonstrate the duplicate effect at least 3/5 attempts? If it requires perfect timing you cannot reliably control, the exploitability claim is weak.

## Real Impact Examples

### Scenario 1: Social Platform Vote Manipulation
A bug bounty platform's "popular reports" feature allowed upvotes to improve report visibility and researcher reputation scores. By sending ~15 parallel upvote requests for the same report using a single HTTP/2 connection (single-packet attack), a researcher was able to register 10–15 votes from a single account. This allowed artificial inflation of report rankings, manipulation of researcher reputation scores, and distortion of the platform's crowdsourced prioritization system — directly undermining trust in the platform's core feature for triaging vulnerability reports.

### Scenario 2: Major Social Network — Duplicate Promotional Actions
On a major social network (Facebook-scale), promotional or limited-use actions — such as adding a phone number for a one-time security credit, or claiming a one-time bonus — were vulnerable to simultaneous parallel requests. An attacker could race the claim endpoint and receive the promotional benefit multiple times, causing direct financial loss to the platform and allowing fraudulent accumulation of platform currency or benefits at scale. Given the user volume, even a brief window before patching represented significant financial exposure.

### Scenario 3: Cloud Infrastructure Provider — Resource Limit Bypass
A cloud hosting provider enforced limits on the number of resources (e.g., droplets, projects, or API keys) a free-tier user could create. The limit check and resource creation were non-atomic operations. By racing the creation endpoint with 20 simultaneous requests, an attacker bypassed the enforcement logic and created resources far exceeding their tier limit. This translated directly to unauthorized compute consumption, billing fraud, and abuse of infrastructure — impacting both the provider's revenue and system stability for legitimate users.

## HTTP/2 Single-Packet Attack — Deep Reference

The single-packet attack is the most important race-condition technique published since 2020. It collapses the race window from "tens of milliseconds with TCP-handshake jitter" to "the time the server's worker pool takes to dispatch N pre-buffered requests" — typically **under 1 ms** for the entire batch. This is what makes modern race exploits viable against rate-limited, distributed, load-balanced backends that previously seemed un-race-able.

Original research: **James Kettle, PortSwigger — "Smashing the State Machine" (DEF CON 31, August 2023)** [portswigger.net/research/smashing-the-state-machine](<target>). 2024 extension: **RyotaK / Flatt Security — "Beyond the Limit: Expanding Single-Packet Race Condition with First Sequence Sync"** [flatt.tech/research/posts/beyond-the-limit-expanding-single-packet-race-condition-with-first-sequence-sync/](<target>).

### Why it works — architecture

A race exploit fails for two reasons that look like the same problem but aren't:
1. **Network jitter** — N requests sent sequentially over the same TCP connection arrive at the server with 0.5–5 ms spread, depending on RTT and congestion.
2. **Server-side dispatch ordering** — even if all N requests arrive in the same millisecond, the worker pool may serialise them via a load balancer or accept-queue.

The single-packet attack solves (1) by exploiting two protocol-level facts about HTTP/2:

- HTTP/2 multiplexes N requests over ONE TCP connection as ONE TLS record per request batch.
- TLS records can carry multiple HTTP/2 `HEADERS` frames, and each HEADERS frame can be the last frame of a separate stream.

So if you pre-stage N requests on a single HTTP/2 connection — **send all the HEADERS frames except the very last byte of each, then release all the final bytes in a single TCP write** — the TCP stack ships them in **one IP packet** (assuming < MTU, ~1500 bytes). The server's kernel hands all N requests to the HTTP/2 parser in the same scheduler tick. The race window is no longer the network — it's the application's own atomicity-failure window.

For (2) — server-side dispatch ordering — Kettle showed that modern backends (Node.js, Go, async Python) dispatch concurrently within microseconds when handed a packet of N pre-parsed requests. Older blocking backends (default Apache prefork, single-threaded PHP-FPM) serialise even with single-packet delivery; for those, the technique helps less but still wins over TCP-stream sequencing.

### Last-byte-sync technique

The exact mechanic Kettle documented:

1. Open one HTTP/2 connection. Negotiate TLS, send the SETTINGS frame, accept the server's.
2. For each of N requests, send its `HEADERS` frame **with the END_HEADERS flag** and a `DATA` frame containing **all but the last byte of the body**. Do NOT set END_STREAM yet.
3. The server cannot dispatch the request because END_STREAM hasn't fired — it's waiting for one more byte.
4. Repeat (2) for all N requests on the same connection. Each is now buffered at the server, parsed up to "almost done".
5. **In a single TCP write, send N tiny `DATA` frames each carrying 1 byte with END_STREAM set.** TCP coalesces them into one outbound segment. The server's HTTP/2 parser sees END_STREAM on all N streams in the same scheduler tick.
6. Server dispatches N requests to N workers in microseconds.

The race window equals the time between worker N's `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` and worker N+1's same query — typically nanoseconds when the workers run on the same CPU.

### Wireshark validation

To confirm your attack tool is genuinely producing one-packet sync (vs accidentally fragmenting):

1. Capture the loopback or your egress interface during the attack: `sudo tcpdump -i lo0 -w race.pcap port 443` (or interface 0).
2. Open in Wireshark, filter `tls and tcp.port == 443`.
3. Find the TLS record containing the END_STREAM flush. It should contain **N H2 DATA frames with END_STREAM set, in one TLS record, in one TCP segment.**
4. If you see N TLS records or N TCP segments, your tool is sequencing. The race window is your inter-segment gap — typically too wide.

The Turbo Intruder `engine=Engine.BURP2` implementation guarantees single-packet delivery on HTTP/2 targets when the request body fits in MTU. For larger bodies, see the "Race-window estimation" subsection below.

### h2.0 single-frame vs h2.cl multi-frame race

Two variants depending on what protocol the target speaks:

- **h2.0 single-frame** (the standard Kettle attack): pure HTTP/2 end-to-end. N requests in one TLS record. Works against any modern HTTPS-fronted target where the front-end advertises `h2` in ALPN. **Default approach.**
- **h2.cl multi-frame**: front-end speaks HTTP/2 to the client, downgrades to HTTP/1.1 to the back-end. Smuggling-adjacent — you craft an HTTP/2 request whose `Content-Length` confuses the front-end into emitting two HTTP/1.1 requests to the back-end on the same connection. Pairs with HTTP request smuggling (see `hunt-http-smuggling`). Useful when single-packet HTTP/2 is filtered at the front-end but the back-end is reachable in HTTP/1.1.

Detect h2.0 viability via `curl -sI --http2 <target> | grep -i HTTP/2`. If the server doesn't speak h2, single-packet is not directly applicable — fall back to "parallel-pipelining" over HTTP/1.1 (much wider race window; usually loses the race against modern backends, but still useful for naive ones).

### Race-window estimation methodology

Before firing the attack, estimate the race window. This determines whether you need single-packet at all, and how many concurrent requests to send.

1. Issue a **single** request to the target endpoint. Capture the response time on the wire: `T_single`.
2. Issue **two sequential** requests. Capture both response times: `T_seq1`, `T_seq2`.
3. Issue **two concurrent** requests over the same connection (via HTTP/2 multiplex or HTTP/1.1 pipeline). Capture both: `T_par1`, `T_par2`.
4. If `T_par1 ≈ T_par2 ≈ T_single`, the server handles both in parallel — race window is `min(T_par1, T_par2)`, single-packet helps a lot.
5. If `T_par2 ≈ T_par1 + T_single`, the server serialises — race window is whatever happens between sequential workers; single-packet helps less but still wins over TCP jitter.
6. For PIN / OTP / coupon-redemption endpoints, expect `T_single` to be 10–100 ms (DB query latency). The race window inside the server is typically < 1 ms (the gap between `SELECT` and `UPDATE` on the same row).
7. **N rule of thumb:** start with `N = 30` concurrent requests for single-packet h2. Increase to 100+ if the target's `T_single` is < 10 ms (very fast endpoint = larger pre-buffer needed to overflow the worker pool). Up to **10,000** with Flatt's first-sequence-sync extension (see below).

### Single-connection-multi-stream vs Multi-connection-single-stream

A decision tree for picking the right shape:

- **Single connection, N streams** (default Kettle / Turbo Intruder BURP2 engine): N concurrent HTTP/2 streams on one TCP connection. **Use when:** target speaks HTTP/2; request body fits in MTU (~1400 bytes after TLS overhead); you need N ≤ ~30.
- **Multiple connections, one stream each** (older parallel HTTP/1.1): N TCP connections, one request per connection. **Use when:** target doesn't speak HTTP/2 OR the request body is large (> MTU). Race window widens significantly (5–50 ms TCP-handshake spread) — only viable on slow servers.
- **Multiple connections, multiple streams** (Flatt's first-sequence-sync, 2024): N TCP connections each carrying M streams. Total = N×M requests. Uses synchronized TCP first-sequence numbers across multiple connections to land all packets at the server in the same processing window. **Use when:** you need N > 30 (e.g., brute-forcing a 6-digit PIN within a 5-attempt rate-limit window — Flatt demonstrated 10,000 requests in 166 ms by splitting across IP fragments with synchronized SEQ numbers).

### Turbo Intruder `Engine.BURP2` template — explained

```python
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    # 1. Engine.BURP2 = HTTP/2 single-packet engine; provides the last-byte-sync primitive.
    engine = RequestEngine(
        endpoint=target.endpoint,
        concurrentConnections=1,          # 2. One TCP connection, multiplexing all streams.
        requestsPerConnection=100,        # 3. Up to 100 concurrent H2 streams. >30 needs Flatt-extension.
        engine=Engine.BURP2,              # 4. THE critical line — selects the single-packet engine.
        pipeline=False,                   # 5. Pipelining is for HTTP/1.1; irrelevant on H2.
    )

    # 6. Build N requests. Each is identical here — racing the same endpoint.
    #    For PIN brute-force, vary the body across requests.
    for i in range(30):
        engine.queue(target.req)

    # 7. openGate(...).complete(...) is the API call that performs last-byte-sync:
    #    - Buffer all 30 requests up to "last byte not sent"
    #    - Release all final bytes in a single TCP write
    #    - openGate returns immediately; complete waits for all responses.
    engine.openGate("race1")
    engine.complete(timeout=10)
```

The `Engine.BURP2` import does the heavy lifting. Behind the scenes:
- Each `engine.queue(req)` adds a HEADERS frame to the connection's send buffer but withholds the last DATA frame byte.
- `openGate("race1")` blocks until all 30 are buffered, then issues a single `socket.send(...)` containing 30 × 1-byte DATA frames with END_STREAM. All 30 cross the wire in one IP packet (assuming < MTU).
- `complete(timeout=10)` collects responses and times.

Inspect each response object: `req.code`, `req.length`, `req.time`. The race is "won" when at least 2 requests return a success that should logically have been mutually exclusive (e.g., both coupon-applies succeed when the redemption limit was 1).

### Flatt's first-sequence-sync extension (when N > 30 is needed)

Kettle's original single-packet caps at roughly N=30 due to MTU + TLS record limits. Flatt Security's RyotaK published the extension in August 2024:

- Take advantage of IP fragmentation: a single "logical" packet at the IP layer can be split across multiple physical IP fragments.
- Force synchronized TCP SEQ numbers across multiple connections by completing the TLS handshakes in lockstep and aligning the SYN/SYN-ACK timing.
- Result: 10,000 concurrent requests delivered to the server in 166 ms, all landing inside a rate-limit window that the server thought was atomic.

Use case: brute-forcing 6-digit PINs (max 10^6 candidates) inside a 5-attempts-per-window cap. Without first-sequence-sync, you'd need ~200,000 windows. With it, ~100 windows.

Implementation: [flatt.tech/research/posts/beyond-the-limit-...](<target>) includes a working PoC.

### Operator playbook (when to reach for what)

| Scenario | Tool / variant |
|---|---|
| Modern HTTPS target, ALPN advertises `h2`, body < 1400 bytes, need N ≤ 30 | Turbo Intruder `Engine.BURP2` single-packet — **default** |
| Same as above but body > MTU | Multi-connection HTTP/2; widen window estimate by ~5 ms |
| Target speaks HTTP/1.1 only (no h2 ALPN) | `curl --next` parallel pipeline; race window is wide; only viable on slow servers |
| Need N > 30 (PIN brute-force, OTP exhaustion within rate-limit window) | Flatt first-sequence-sync extension; manual implementation per the writeup |
| Front-end h2, back-end h1 (CDN+origin) | h2.cl smuggling variant — pairs with `hunt-http-smuggling` |
| Quick reproducibility test on a single endpoint | `curl --next --next --next --next` (4-shot parallel HTTP/1.1) — wide window but no setup |

### Anti-patterns

- **Don't claim "race condition" from observing two near-simultaneous successes in Burp Repeater "Send group in parallel" mode** — that mode pipelines over HTTP/1.1 with millisecond-spread, not single-packet. Triagers know this and downgrade.
- **Don't submit without Wireshark confirmation** for high-value race claims. The deliverable that pays best: PoC video showing Turbo Intruder firing + Wireshark capture showing all N END_STREAM frames in one TCP segment + N successful responses that should have been mutually exclusive.
- **Don't use single-packet against endpoints that genuinely don't race** (e.g., endpoints with row-level locks and transactions). The window estimation step exists to filter these out before you spend 2 hours building the PoC.

## Related Skills & Chains

- **`hunt-business-logic`** — Race conditions are the "concurrency arm" of every business-logic state machine. Chain primitive: business logic (coupon/promo) + race-condition single-packet attack → coupon redeemed N times → direct financial loss.
- **`hunt-mfa-bypass`** — OTP-expiry windows and replay protection are classic race targets. Chain primitive: race + MFA-validate endpoint → bypass OTP expiry by submitting N concurrent validations within the validity window.
- **`hunt-ato`** — Race conditions on password reset, email change, and account creation enable persistent ATO. Chain primitive: race on email-change endpoint + atomic-update missing → swap victim email + read reset token before user notice.
- **`hunt-api-misconfig`** — Wallet/balance/credit endpoints without atomic UPDATE are double-spend candidates. Chain primitive: race + atomic-update missing → double-spend balance → withdraw N× user balance.
- **`security-arsenal`** — Load the Turbo Intruder single-packet template, h2.cl smuggling for atomic submit, and `curl --next` parallel multi-request patterns.
- **`triage-validation`** — Apply the Statistical-Sampling gate: a single anomalous response is noise; require 1 successful + N duplicate / over-quota / stale-state demonstrations with response screenshots before reporting.
